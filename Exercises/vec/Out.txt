ToString method for constructed vectors
v = 1, 2, 3
u = 1, 2, 3
-v = -1, -2, -3
-u = -3, -2, -1

Testing if scalar operator works as intended
v*2 = 2, 4, 6
v*2.5 = 2.5, 5, 7.5
v*-3.0 = -3, -6, -9
v*2.0 = -2, -4, -6
v*2.5 = -2.5, -5, -7.5
v*-2.0 = 2.5, 5, 7.5
Does v*(-1) = -v: True
Does -v = v*(-1): True

Testing if + operator works as intended
